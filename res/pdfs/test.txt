FEATURE TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION DESCRIPTION

SUSTAINABLE Post-consumer recycled plastic (PCR) and closed loop ITE derived  Post-consumer recycled plastic is plastic waste generated by households, 
MATERIALS1 plastic - chasses industrial, commercial or institutions repurposed in the design. Closed loop plastic 

Closed loop ITE derived plastic-NA is reclaimed plastic from any disposed IT product repurposed in the  design.
Post-consumer recycled plastic:30% in LCD cover lid, 30% in LCD antenna 
window, 50% in LCD bezel, 50% in palm-rest, 50% in inner frame, 30% in 
bottom door (for non 2-in-1 configurations) 35% in battery filler, 50% in 
battery housing, 30% in speaker enclosure

Post-consumer recycled plastic (PCR) -  power adapter:
(65-Watt): 95% in adapter case and AC inlet  
(100-Watt): 90% in adapter case  
(60-Watt): 50% in adapter case  

Recycled aluminum - power adapter: Recycling aluminum helps divert material from landfills, where it would otherwise 
(65-Watt): 98% recycled aluminum in thermal shielding contribute to the growing problem of waste disposal. Aluminum is durable and 

does not degrade during the recycling process, making it a material that can be 
recycled repeatedly.

Recycled copper -  power adapter: Recycling copper helps preserve finite natural resources because it reduces the 
(100-watt): 50% recycled copper in adapter cable need for extensive mining and extraction of copper ore that is a more energy 

intensive process

Recycled ocean-bound plastic:  Ocean-bound plastic is collected within 50km (30mi) distance of an ocean 
28% ocean bound plastic in fan housing coastline or major waterway that feeds into the ocean. Using ocean-bound plastic 

reduces the risk of endangering marine life and ecosystem with plastic waste.

Bio-based plastic: Bio-based materials that are derived from non-petroleum-based biological 
21% bio-based material in LCD cover lid, 21% bio-based material in resources. The bio-based plastic used in the lid and door is derived from tall-oil, a 
bottom door (for non 2-in-1 configurations) 42% bio-based material in  byproduct in the paper making process.  
the feet at the bottom of the device

Reclaimed carbon fiber: Reclaimed carbon fiber is derived from waste generated in the production of 
20% in LCD cover lid; 20% in bottom door (for non 2-in-1 configurations) carbon fiber for the aerospace industry. It is considered to be a pre-consumer 

recycled material.

Recycled cobalt: Majority of recycled cobalt used in PC batteries is sourced from the EV batteries 
50% in battery and the remainder is sourced from consumer electronics. Virgin cobalt resources 

are fast depleting and using recycled cobalt helps build a circular economy. Using 
recycled cobalt is a less energy intensive process and produces lesser waste than 
mining virgin cobalt.

Recycled or renewable packaging: materials: Using recycled or renewable materials lowers waste and helps lower 
100% recycled, renewable and recyclable packaging environmental impact. Materials may include recycled content and/or renewable 

content, in the form of sustainably forested fibers.

FEATURE TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION DESCRIPTION
DELL OPTIMIZER Power Optimization Intelligent features to protect battery life and delivery energy savings. AI-based 

Dynamic Charge Policy adapts to usage behavior to apply optimal charge setting. 
Intelligent Battery Extender preserves runtime by making system adjustments 
when battery is low. Advanced Charge will charge battery before start of day and 
prevent overcharging. ExpressCharge will provide up to 90% charge in one hour.* 
Select lower energy-cost times of day to charge with Peak Shift. Thermal settings 
(optimized, cool, quiet, ultra performance) to balance PC performance and fan 
noise. Battery health report. Critical firmware alerts and notifications. (*Disclaimer: 
*Based on A Principled Technologies Report commissioned by Dell that ran PC 
performance benchmarks on Dell Latitude 9430 laptops and OptiPlex 7400 all-in-
one desktop PCs: Improve PC app performance, battery charging, and end-user 
experiences with Dell Optimizer, June 2023).

Intelligent Audio AI-based neural noise technology removes intrusive background sounds, echoes, and 
reverb caused by room acoustics from all ends of conference calls as well as mutes 
all background noises when no speech is detected. Will also provide automated 
tuning for optimized sound quality and on-screen notifications if voice quality drops in 
conference calls.

Presence Detection Sensors detect your presence, and onlookers, to conserve battery runtime and 
protect screen privacy. Wake on Approach awakens system and works with 
Windows Hello to sign you in, hands free. Look Away Dim darkens your screen and 
Walk Away lock turns off your display helping protect runtime and provide screen 
privacy. Keep Alive feature won’t let your screen dim when you are still present but 
are not actively engaging with your PC. Onlooker Detection will alert you or obscure 
your screen to provide privacy.

Network Optimization Automatically switches to the best allowable Wi-Fi network when congestion is 
detected and uses multiple wired and wireless network connections to transfer 
data up to 2x faster and improve download speed.* Allocates the maximum 
bandwidth to conference application when you are on a call. (*Disclaimer:

a discrete graphics card, built in 4K panel, Dolby Vision or CyberLink Blue-ray player; for other configurations HEVC content playback on the system will require a separate 
purchase and download of software HEVC codec or third-party media players.

7. Latitude 5550 and Latitude 5540 tested across multiple configurations. Battery life results were compared for like-to-like configs (i.e., same or similar memory, storage, 
    display, battery, etc.) except for CPU. Based on testing using the Mobile Mark 2025 battery life benchmark test in February 2024.  For more information about this

4.  <1% CPU usage when running on-device AI based security like CrowdStrike. Based on Intel and CrowdStrike testing. Results may vary. These results should not be taken 
with the understanding that the ratio of CPU usage, memory usage, or inference time between CPU only and CPU+NPU will remain the same with a different/smaller  
model – even one using the same neural architecture as the model under test. This is also not a general claim about the performance of other models on the NPU, 
even other CNNs. The result should only be taken as an understanding that, for this specific Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model developed by CrowdStrike, a 
smaller distilled model of the same design would likely have an average inference time after the first of <= ~25ms and a CPU overhead <= ~1%. Note that featurization/
